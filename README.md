Coding Test Instructions
========================

The purpose of this test is to determine your ability to learn quickly, analyze
problems, and produce logic to solve these problems. I will also be looking at
code readability and cleanliness.

In this tarball
---------------

You'll find a sample data set in three different forms, for your convenience.
Specifically, data.sqlite3 (sqlite3 database), data.sql (a MySQL database dump),
and data.json (a JSON object).

This test set also includes example output in the form of an HTML page:
index.html.

Problem
-------

Your task is to use the data provided and implement some sort of application
(Ruby on Rails, Django, Laravel, React, node.js, your own custom application,
etc.) to output the data in a format that matches as closely as possible the
HTML structure shown in index.html (the actual HTML, not just how it looks
when rendered in the browser). Your solution should accept any data set like
the one provided, so it must allow any number of skills per person, any number
of jobs, and any number of applicants. Your solution *must not* use CSS styles
to format the HTML, except for what is already provided in the index.html
example.
